		<h1 class="card-title-la">Litter Announcements!</h1>
		<br>
		<p class="paras">We are excited to announce some updated breeding plans for our Summer 2020 litters!! Be sure to visit parents page to view moms and dads.</p> <br>
		<h3 class="head3"><u><b>3/31/2020 Update:</b></u><h3>
		<p class="paras">-At this time all of the puppies that we have now have deposits placed on them.</p>
		<p class="paras">- We are planning an F1 and an F1b litter bred in April and ready for families early summer. We are taking deposits on these litters.</p>
		<p class="paras">*We will be breeding this week so check back to see who the parents will be.</p>
		<br>
		
		<hr>		
		<br>
		
		<p class="paras">
		Our puppies are amazing, and they will melt your heart. They are selected in deposit order, at our home, when they reach 4 weeks old. We keep the puppies for an additional 3-4 weeks to work with them on socializing and housetraining. We'll also provide some tips to help you with training and acclimating your puppy into your life.</p>
		
		<p class="paras">
		When buying our puppies, the deposit payment will be $200. Typically there are 8 puppies per litter, although it is not uncommon to have more. After the puppies are born, there will be more puppies available. We are more than glad to help you select your puppy and share our knowledge of temperaments, coats, and anything you want to know more about. After all, everyone is looking for something different in a puppy!!</p>
		
		<p class="paras">
		Many of our puppies have gone on to be service and therapy dogs, and of course, amazing family pets. It's common that after a family falls in love with their first VA Beach goldendoodle, they come back for another. Our goldendoodles are standard in size, so typically our females are approximately 55 pounds and our males are approximately 65pounds.</p>

		<p class="paras">
		We have a Facebook group, which is Virginia Beach Goldendoodles, that you can join and follow us. We have tons of puppy pictures from our past litters and see what people are saying about us. Again, dates are approximated as the mother is in process with her new borns. Please let us know if you have any questions.</p>
