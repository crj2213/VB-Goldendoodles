  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">Let us tell you a little bit about ourselves and how our journey began:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li> We began breeding Goldendoodles in 2003. We kept a Goldendoodle from our first breeding. She is the famous Shenleigh O’Doodle! She has become an ambassador for the breed. </li>
		<li> Over 25 years, we’ve occasionally bred our own personal dogs including Bouviers, Corgis, Dobermans, and Golden Retrievers. After raising our two boys with Dobermans, we discovered Standard Poodles. We loved their intelligence, agility, and non-shedding. After some diligent research, we discovered goldendoodles! </li>
		<li> We’re located in rural Virginia Beach. We live on over 6 1/2 acres of land, so our dogs and puppies get plenty of fresh air and exercise. We all enjoy lots of nature and many beautiful sunsets. </li>
		<li> We have established ourselves a top reputation for producing smart, happy, healthy, well-structured dogs with great temperaments and intelligence. We earned the distinction of being listed as recommended breeders at the worldwide website Goldendoodles.com.</li>

    <p class="card-text">  A Goldendoodle is a hybrid cross between a Golden Retriever and a Standard Poodle. They are a fantastic mix of two amazing and intelligent dog breeds. They are the perfect dog for many reasons: </p>
	<ul> 
		<li>They are very intelligent. The Standard Poodle is #2 on the dog smart scale & the Golden Retriever is #4. </li>
		<li>They LOVE people as they were originally bred to be therapy dogs. </li>
		<li>They are very easy to train as they want to please you. </li>
		<li>They have a gorgeous coat ranging from curly to wavy.</li>
		<li>They don’t shed and there’s no dander, so you don’t get the “wet dog” smell. </li>
		<li>They do well with people with allergies. </li>

	<h3 class="card-title">Temperament</h3>
    <p class="card-text">Our Goldendoodle puppies are raised and nurtured by our family when they’re born. We begin socializing our puppies on day one. From the moment we begin raising the puppies, we teach with them to be confident, smart, and trusting family members. At 2 weeks of age, they begin receiving visitors. From that point, they are held, kissed, taught, and played with by families and friends. We invite people who have placed deposits to come and select their puppy at about 4 weeks of age. Afterwards, we keep the puppies until they are ready for you at about 7–8 weeks of age. This gives us time to keep working on socializing and housetraining. </p> <p>We raise our Goldendoodles as part of our family in preparation for your family. Once you have selected your puppy, you are welcome to visit. This is great for socialization, and when the puppies leave our home with your family, you will already know each other. This is a great stress reliever for both the puppy and family! We work hard to housetrain by providing lots of outside exercise and daily play. We also train them to learn the difference between their sleeping area, playing area, and potty area. In addition to these training skills, we send our puppies home with tips which include crate training, grooming, recommended toys, and much more! </p> <p>We offer lifetime support! We’ll provide our email and phone number to you, and if you have any questions, we are glad to answer them. We’ll also provide you with any support and training tips that you may need. All we ask for is for pictures as we enjoy seeing our babies adjust to their families and grow up to be gorgeous Virginia Beach Goldendoodles!!! </p>
